  This image sets up the calibre desktop app and makes its interface available via Guacamole server in the browser. The interface is available at `http://your-ip:8080`.

  By default, there is no username or password set. Custom usernames and passwords can be set via optional docker environment variables. Keep in mind that the `GUACPASS` variable accepts the `md5 hash` of the desired password (the sample above is the hash for `abc`). The md5 hash can be generated by either of the following commands:

  ```
  echo -n password | openssl md5
  ```

  ```
  printf '%s' password | md5sum
  ```

  Port 8081 is reserved for Calibre's built-in webserver, which can be enabled within the desktop app settings, and the internal port must be set to `8081` although it will then be available at the host mapped port for external access.
  
  You can access advanced features of the Guacamole remote desktop using `ctrl`+`alt`+`shift` enabling you to use remote copy/paste and different languages.
